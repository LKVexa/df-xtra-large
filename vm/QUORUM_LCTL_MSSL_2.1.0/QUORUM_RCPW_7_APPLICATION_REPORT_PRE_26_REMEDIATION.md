# QUORUM RC-PW 7.0 Application to Generic LCTL/MSSL VM 5.0.0 Candidate

## Result

- Base hosted QVM: **OPERATIONAL**
- Base production 5.0.0 gate: **PARTIAL**
- RC-PW hosted world subsystem: **OPERATIONAL**
- Full RC-PW 7.0 workflow gate: **PARTIAL**
- Demonstrated local profile: **QP1 / WQ2 / AW1 / WP1_SINGLE**

## Applied workflow

The attached RC-PW 7.0 series was copied into `vm/wf/r700/input_workflow_series/` and its 582 atomic requirements were applied to a conservative evidence ledger.

Status counts:

- OPERATIONAL: 241
- PARTIAL: 315
- BLOCKED: 26

These statuses are profile-scoped. OPERATIONAL means the bounded hosted reference mechanism was implemented and locally tested; it does not promote missing production, rendering, native-runtime, multi-worker, cross-platform, soak, or independent evidence.

## Implemented runtime changes

- QVM service ABI raised from 1 to 2 while retaining ISA 1 and the 24 existing opcodes.
- Capability-gated RC-PW services 16-31 added to the QVM runtime.
- Deterministic canonical world state with stable entities/regions.
- Reference-centered finite-horizon fold projection and S0-S8/L0-L8 views.
- No-unload entity persistence.
- Remote ecology/economy reference simulation.
- Causal hash-chain ledger.
- Deterministic world-package compiler.
- Frontier generation, archive/rehydration, knowledge locality, succession, authority wells, idempotent transfers, save/load/replay and partition metadata.
- Columned LCTL-C guest program `vm/src/WORLD_DEMO.lctlc` verified by bundled LCTL 1.6.1-RC1.
- MSSL world semantic authority documents derived in the style of the supplied MSSL Writers Corpus.

## Fresh evidence

- 20/20 existing QVM tests PASS.
- 25/25 RC-PW world tests PASS.
- WORLD_DEMO Columned LCTL verification PASS.
- Deterministic world compiler comparison PASS.
- Deterministic world guest replay comparison PASS.
- 10,000-tick reference stress PASS with no invariant errors.
- 21 selected Golden World scenarios executed locally and PASS; 59 are explicitly NOT_RUN.
- Base repository regression gate PASS in the QVM qualification run.

## Claim boundary

Hosted deterministic reference world. Native world primitives, production renderer/physics/AI fidelity, true multi-worker fabric, all 80 Golden Worlds, cross-platform, independent replay and production soak remain partial or blocked.

The package therefore represents a materially executable application of the RC-PW workflow to the hosted VM candidate, not a claim that every production-level requirement in the 582-item series has been fully qualified.
