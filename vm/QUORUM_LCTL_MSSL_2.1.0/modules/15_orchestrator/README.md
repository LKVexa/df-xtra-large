# 15. Orchestrator — QUORUM LCTL/MSSL Reimagination

**Plane:** `orchestration`  
**Semantic authority:** `authority/module.mssl`  
**Execution plan:** `execution/module.lctlc`  
**Legacy evidence:** `evidence/legacy_map.json`

## Reimagined role

Independent JA Agent Language scripts for suite fan-out, deterministic fan-in, load order, conflict resolution, and synthesis.

The MSSL document is the sealed declarative contract for this suite. The Columned LCTL plan is the compact execution-facing contract and is only authoritative after lowering to canonical LCTL and passing the supplied canonical verifier. The original repository sources are retained under `legacy/source_repository/` for traceability and differential testing.

## Qualification boundary

This package proves repository structure, MSSL seal integrity, LCTL-C lowering, and canonical LCTL verification for the generated execution skeleton. It does **not** claim behavioral equivalence between every legacy JA/DeepML artifact and the new dual-language contract until suite-specific behavioral fixtures are supplied and pass.
