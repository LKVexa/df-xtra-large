# 010 — RCPW-01-R24

## Stage

**01 — Canonical World Authority**

## Exact requirement

> A canonical-state verifier can validate identity uniqueness, topology closure, revision consistency, ledger correspondence, and partition ownership without rendering the world.

## Current state

- Status: **PARTIAL**
- Current blocker: A bounded hosted reference mechanism or contract exists, but the requirement exceeds the implemented local fidelity or qualification scope.
- Existing evidence pointer: `world/evidence/qualification_summary.json`
- Current profile: `QP1/WQ2/AW1/WP1_SINGLE`
- Remediation tier: `T3_FABRIC`
- Test families: `TRANSACTION_CONCURRENCY, FOLD_PROPERTY, IDENTITY_PERSISTENCE, CAUSAL_REPLAY, PRESENTATION_REGRESSION, MULTI_WORKER_CONFORMANCE`

## QUORUM requirement-specific prompt

Using QUORUM, modify the actual RC-PW 7 VM candidate to make **RCPW-01-R24** fully evidence-backed OPERATIONAL. The exact semantic obligation is: **A canonical-state verifier can validate identity uniqueness, topology closure, revision consistency, ledger correspondence, and partition ownership without rendering the world.** Treat this as a T3_FABRIC remediation. Preserve canonical identity, topology, time, ownership, causality, save/replay compatibility, and all existing passing behavior. Use MSSL for semantic authority; use Columned LCTL/canonical LCTL when this behavior belongs in native guest execution; use the hosted VM world-service layer where that is the repository's declared architecture. Do not satisfy this requirement with prose, mocks, prewritten evidence, or a status edit.

## Primary implementation targets

- `vm/world/world_runtime.py`
- `vm/world/authority/world_core.mssl`
- `vm/world/compiler/world_compiler.py`
- `vm/world/spec/WORLD_RUNTIME.md`

## Detailed workflow

1. **Baseline the exact requirement.** Capture the current PARTIAL record for `RCPW-01-R24`, all existing tests that touch it, and canonical/ledger digests for a minimal deterministic scenario.
2. **Write/strengthen the semantic contract.** In the Stage 01 MSSL authority, define the state owner, allowed mutations, inputs/outputs, units/domains if numeric, invariants, failure semantics, persistence/replay obligations, and profile scope needed by this exact requirement.
3. **Close the implementation gap.** Implement the behavior required by `RCPW-01-R24` in the real target paths. If a bounded mechanism already exists, raise its fidelity until the entire requirement—not only a simplified approximation—is exercised.
4. **Bind direct instrumentation.** Add requirement-ID-tagged assertions/telemetry so the qualifier can observe the exact property without inferring it from unrelated tests.
5. **TRANSACTION_CONCURRENCY.** Declare read/write sets, expected revisions, ownership/token semantics, and commit/abort behavior.
6. **TRANSACTION_CONCURRENCY.** Randomize ordering/retries/stale inputs and prove one deterministic canonical result with no duplicate mutation.
7. **FOLD_PROPERTY.** Use property-based vectors for near-field identity, monotonicity, boundedness, continuity, unique inverse targeting, and canonical-topology preservation.
8. **FOLD_PROPERTY.** Inject invalid/singular/out-of-range cases and prove explicit safe failure or fallback.
9. **IDENTITY_PERSISTENCE.** Track stable IDs, ownership, references, lifecycle/tombstone state, and historical lineage through fold/save/migration cycles.
10. **IDENTITY_PERSISTENCE.** Inject stale copies, duplicate ownership attempts, retirement/destruction, and reconstruction; verify no fork/resurrection.
11. **CAUSAL_REPLAY.** Emit deterministic event IDs, causal parents, pre/post references, seeds/model versions, and semantic digests.
12. **CAUSAL_REPLAY.** Replay/reconstruct from checkpoint + history, then corrupt/reorder/omit events and verify first-divergence detection.
13. **PRESENTATION_REGRESSION.** Build deterministic reference frames/descriptors for the exact visual/audio property and bind them to world/fold/reference versions.
14. **PRESENTATION_REGRESSION.** Measure seam/popping/jitter/artifact and frame-budget metrics over fixed traversal traces; preserve canonical digests across quality degradation.
15. **MULTI_WORKER_CONFORMANCE.** Run the same seeded scenario under 1, 2, and 4 spawned workers or the highest practical hosted profile using deterministic commit semantics.
16. **MULTI_WORKER_CONFORMANCE.** Randomize worker completion/order, repartition or restart one worker, and compare canonical/ledger/save digests.
17. **Adversarial closure.** Test malformed, stale, duplicate/replayed, interrupted, unsupported-version, and resource-exhaustion inputs wherever meaningful to this requirement; failures must preserve the last known-good canonical state.
18. **Deterministic replay.** Re-run the deterministic fixture at least twice and compare canonical checkpoint and semantic-ledger digests. If the requirement is presentation-only, additionally prove canonical digest invariance.
19. **Profile/fidelity closure.** Execute the actual fidelity/profile named by the requirement. Do not promote a hosted approximation to a production/native/external claim. Record exact environment and limitations.
20. **Regression.** Run the relevant stage suite plus base VM tests, existing RC-PW tests, blocker-remediation tests, world compiler determinism, LCTL verification, and any upstream/downstream stages affected by the change.
21. **Evidence receipt.** Emit `vm/world/evidence/remediation_315/RCPW-01-R24.json` conforming to `00`, including exact commands, exit codes, observed values, digests, profile, hashes, and blocker field.
22. **Promotion decision.** Change `RCPW-01-R24` from PARTIAL to OPERATIONAL only if its evidence predicate passes. If any mandatory high-profile environment is unavailable, retain the appropriate profile cell as PARTIAL/BLOCKED and state the missing evidence explicitly.

## Acceptance criteria

- the exact statement `A canonical-state verifier can validate identity uniqueness, topology closure, revision consistency, ledger correspondence, and partition ownership without rendering the world.` is directly asserted by executable evidence;
- positive and boundary tests pass;
- applicable negative/fault cases fail safely;
- deterministic replay/semantic digests match where applicable;
- canonical truth is not silently altered by rendering/folding/LOD optimization;
- all previously passing regressions remain passing;
- the evidence receipt is fresh, hash-bound, and profile-scoped;
- the requirement-specific qualifier resolves to **OPERATIONAL**, not merely 'implemented'.
