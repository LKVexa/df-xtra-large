# JA21 Suite 45 — Localization and Large File Plane

Seven independent JA Interface Language scripts for multilingual presentation, presentation accessibility, bounded large-file windows, repository-scale navigation, the Localization System, the Large File System, and the application-wide Accessibility System.

## Language profile

- Language: JA Interface Language
- Profile: `ja.interface`
- Extension: `.jaui`
- Header: `ja source 0.3`
- Kernel: `ja-kernel-0.3`
- Corpus version: `0.1.0-provisional`
- Corpus records: 10,000
- Primary artifact: `InterfaceArtifact`
- Runtime posture: deterministic modeled behavior, no network, capability-gated actions, bounded resource access, and no unknown-code execution

The attached seven-record gzip bundle was integrity-checked. Its embedded manifest identifies 10,000 JA Interface examples, including localization, accessibility, focus management, keyboard workflows, navigation, resource loading, responsive behavior, typed state, derived values, permission controls, portal-scene embedding, R12 compiler evidence, and MCRT runtime evidence.

The corpus status is `provisional-generated-not-production-compiler-validated`. These files are specification-level JA interface programs rather than HTML, JavaScript, C#, or framework-specific components. Production use requires a conforming JA Interface compiler and approved localization, repository, file-window, accessibility, and evidence adapters.

## Analytical ensemble

| Participant | Suite 45 responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| SOPHIA | Interprets locale, regional, accessibility, file-window, repository, navigation, and task intent |
| CHARLOTTE | Validates catalogs, message coverage, formatting, accessible semantics, source identity, ranges, indexes, freshness, limits, permissions, and evidence |
| LANDON | Applies validated presentation profiles, loads bounded windows, navigates indexed results, coordinates caches, and preserves deterministic state |
| Professor | Explains fallbacks, accessibility behavior, omitted ranges, repository scope, errors, uncertainty, limitations, and repair paths |
| Podium | Presents source and semantic hashes, locale and accessibility evidence, range receipts, index freshness, R12/MCRT evidence, provenance, and certification status |

Every script contains a named component for all five participants, requires approved actions, asserts a complete keyboard path, and binds a stable evidence viewport.

## Why similarly named sub-suites remain separate

- **Multilingual presentation** handles one interface rendering in one selected locale. The **Localization System** manages application-wide message catalogs, fallback graphs, regional formats, coverage, versions, and profile changes.
- **Accessibility presentation** validates a single screen, panel, dialog, preview, or large-file window. The **Accessibility System** applies user profiles and verifies consistent behavior across every application surface and lifecycle transition.
- **Bounded large-file windows** define one safe read window. The **Large File System** coordinates indexing, caching, paging, cancellation, recovery, and many windows over large resources.

## Common interface contract

Every script independently declares:

1. `ja source 0.3`, `use Interface`, and a stable module identity.
2. `policy no_network`.
3. Typed local state using `Text?` and `Flag`.
4. Derived enablement that blocks missing selections and concurrent actions.
5. SOPHIA, CHARLOTTE, LANDON, Professor, and Podium components.
6. Accessible button roles, names, and complete keyboard paths.
7. Permission-gated actions using `admin.action:approved`.
8. A stable portal-scene evidence viewport and motion timeline.
9. One named emitted interface artifact.

Expected compiler route:

```text
source -> parse -> AST -> typed state and component resolution
-> permission, localization, accessibility, range, and navigation validation
-> canonicalization -> R12 lowering -> bounded adapter request
-> MCRT interface evidence -> deterministic InterfaceArtifact
```

## Adapter boundary

The `.jaui` files express UI state and validated action intent. Translation catalogs, locale data, assistive-technology bridges, repository indexes, filesystem bytes, archives, spreadsheets, PDFs, media, and source-control metadata remain behind typed adapters.

Each adapter must declare:

- Stable adapter, provider, repository, resource, file, index, locale, profile, and schema identities.
- Input/output types, version, encoding, normalization, and canonical hash rules.
- Allowed effects, capability requirements, permissions, and data classification.
- Window units, offsets, lengths, overlap, maximum size, timeouts, cancellation, retry, and idempotency.
- Freshness, invalidation, cache, mutation detection, recovery, and replay behavior.
- Redaction, retention, provenance, diagnostics, receipt schema, and determinism class.

No component may execute file content, infer an undeclared encoding, scan outside the selected repository, bypass a range bound, expose a credential, perform hidden network transport, or convert incomplete data into a complete result.

## Sub-suite contracts

### 45.1 Multilingual presentation

- Locale identity, language, region, script, direction, catalog version, fallback chain, timezone, calendar, numbering, currency, measurement, and plural rules are explicit.
- Labels, accessible names, errors, status messages, help, evidence, and action text use the same resolved locale.
- Bidirectional isolation prevents injected direction changes from corrupting surrounding controls.
- Missing or stale translations remain visibly diagnosed; fallback never silently changes meaning.
- Locale switching preserves task state, focus identity, selection, and evidence.

### 45.2 Accessibility presentation

- Every visible control has a stable name, role, state, value, description, focus order, and keyboard operation.
- Text alternatives describe meaningful images, charts, animations, icons, and status changes.
- Contrast, zoom, reflow, reduced motion, high contrast, screen-reader order, captions, transcripts, and error association are validated.
- Focus is restored after dialogs, errors, window changes, locale switches, and async completion.
- Color, position, animation, sound, and pointer-only gestures are never the sole carriers of meaning.

### 45.3 Bounded large-file windows

- File identity, canonical path, source hash, size, media type, encoding, unit, offset, requested length, actual range, overlap, and snapshot version are explicit.
- The adapter returns at most the approved window and reports truncation, omitted content, record boundaries, and continuation identity.
- UTF encodings, CSV rows, spreadsheet sheets, archive entries, PDF pages, source lines, media frames, and binary bytes use type-appropriate boundaries.
- Range arithmetic is overflow checked; negative, reversed, overlapping-invalid, out-of-bounds, or stale windows fail explicitly.
- Selection, copy, search, annotation, and evidence retain global source coordinates rather than local-window coordinates alone.

### 45.4 Repository-scale navigation

- “Open repository” selects the input or work repository used by the program; it does not default to the installed application’s source tree.
- Repository selection is presented through one clear repository window or dropdown, not a nesting-doll folder scavenger hunt.
- Stable repository identity, worktree, root, index version, branch or snapshot, filters, query, symbols, dependencies, results, and freshness are visible.
- Results are virtualized, sortable, filterable, keyboard accessible, and addressable by stable global identities.
- Breadcrumbs describe logical scope without requiring the user to manually traverse every directory level.
- Search never escapes the approved repository root or merges results from stale and current snapshots without disclosure.

### 45.5 Localization System

- Catalog extraction, translation, review, validation, packaging, fallback, loading, and invalidation have separate evidence states.
- Message keys are stable; source text is not treated as the durable identity.
- Variable names, types, plural/select branches, markup, access keys, and accessible-name relationships are preserved across translations.
- Locale packs are signed or hash-verified before activation and cannot introduce executable content.
- Language selectors accommodate long language names without clipping and remain keyboard and screen-reader accessible.

### 45.6 Large File System

- Indexing, chunking, cache fill, eviction, prefetch, cancellation, resume, and mutation invalidation are deterministic and bounded.
- Memory, CPU, disk, open-handle, concurrency, decompression, archive-depth, row, page, frame, and output limits are explicit.
- The system supports thousands of files without forcing full materialization or blocking the interface thread.
- Partial, stale, unavailable, malformed, encrypted, or changed resources retain distinct states.
- Cache hits are accepted only when file identity, hash, snapshot, range, decoding profile, and policy all match.
- Interrupted operations resume from verified checkpoints without duplicate reads, skipped ranges, or fabricated completeness.

### 45.7 Accessibility System

- User-selected profiles cover zoom, contrast, text spacing, reduced motion, input mode, captions, transcripts, announcements, and assistive-technology preferences.
- Profiles persist across tabs, editors, repository windows, previews, terminals, dialogs, and sessions without overriding explicit safety constraints.
- Application-wide audits cover names, roles, focus, reading order, keyboard paths, live regions, timeouts, alternatives, and localized accessibility strings.
- Accessibility defects block certification even when the visual presentation appears correct.
- Overrides are visible, scoped, reversible, explained, and recorded with the affected surface identities.

## Large-resource navigation order

```text
select work repository -> validate root and snapshot -> resolve index
-> query/filter -> select resource -> request bounded window
-> validate range and freshness -> render accessible localized window
-> record Podium evidence
```

A downstream viewport cannot erase an upstream root violation, stale snapshot, range error, missing translation, accessibility defect, permission denial, or incomplete evidence.

## Admission gate

An interface artifact is admitted only when:

- Module, interface, component, action, scene, timeline, adapter, repository, file, window, locale, accessibility profile, and evidence identities are stable.
- State types and derived expressions resolve.
- Every action has a required capability and approved permission.
- Repository scope and file-window bounds are explicit and current.
- Locale coverage, fallback, direction, formatting, and accessible strings are valid.
- Keyboard path, focus, names, roles, contrast, reflow, text alternatives, captions, and reduced-motion behavior satisfy the selected profile.
- No network, unknown-code execution, content execution, credential exposure, root escape, unbounded read, or undeclared side effect is requested.
- R12, MCRT, adapter receipt, interface artifact, and Podium evidence identify the same accepted action.

The interface must not invent a file, range, repository result, translation, accessibility result, adapter receipt, or evidence record.

## Evaluation matrix

| Class | Representative test | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Positive | Valid locale, accessible controls, indexed repository, bounded current range, and complete evidence | Pass |
| Negative | Missing catalog key, clipped label, inaccessible control, root escape, stale index, or unbounded read | Expected fail |
| Boundary | Longest language name, RTL transition, exact zoom/reflow threshold, first/last byte, maximum window, or empty repository | Pass or explicit diagnostic |
| Integration | Locale, accessibility, repository, file, range, adapter, and evidence identities agree | Pass |
| Security | Path traversal, archive bomb, content execution, credential exposure, permission bypass, or hidden network | Deny |
| Performance | Repository queries and bounded windows meet declared UI budgets without blocking input | Pass within profile |
| Determinism | Repeated requests preserve selection, range, decode, focus, transition, and receipt order | Pass |
| Interoperability | Filesystem, archive, PDF, spreadsheet, media, repository, locale, and assistive adapters preserve semantics | Pass |
| Recovery | Interrupted indexing or loading resumes without skipped ranges, duplicates, or stale cache acceptance | Pass or explicit restart requirement |
| Certification | R12, MCRT, localization, accessibility, adapter, range, and Podium evidence are complete | Pass |

## Optimization restrictions

Permitted optimization includes component reuse, catalog caching, deterministic index lookup, bounded window prefetch, derived-value caching, event batching, layout planning, and list or editor virtualization when observable UI and accessibility semantics remain equivalent.

Optimization must not clip translated labels, reorder focus, omit offscreen content from assistive navigation, change file-window bounds, merge stale and current snapshots, escape the selected work repository, execute content, skip permissions, hide errors, erase provenance, or change stable R12/MCRT identities.

## 8S coupling and R12 preservation

When Smithson 8S Coupled Mechanics is enabled, the interface preserves latent geometry, product-state separation, projected geometry, semantic distance, uncertainty, provenance, phase, and interaction order independently:

```text
C5 = [C4 | e]
e_perp = (I - C4*C4^+)e
eta_ind = ||e_perp||^2 / (||e||^2 + epsilon)
Admit(8S) iff eta_ind >= epsilon_ind and Delta_8S > epsilon_gain
```

R12 and Podium evidence retain the fifth-coordinate meaning, `eta_ind`, `W`, optional `H`, `g5`, `delta8`, `g3`, `gJ`, projection version, uncertainty, provenance, interaction order, relation class, interface/action identity, repository and window identity, locale, accessibility result, adapter receipt, and limitations.

If `g5 > tol5` while `g3 <= tol3`, record `PROJECTION_ONLY`; apparent visual overlap in a localized or virtualized view is not proof of latent coupling or source identity. Smithson 8S is treated as a proposed computational framework, not an established physical law, proof of standard `S^8` topology, or evidence of physical quantum entanglement.

## Acceptance gate

Suite 45 is certifiable only when all seven scripts preserve no-network policy, typed state, valid derived enablement, permission-gated actions, five-role components, complete keyboard paths, stable localized presentation, bounded large-file access, repository-root confinement, application-wide accessibility, R12/MCRT evidence, and named emitted interface artifacts.
