# Cross-Reference Integrity Diagnostic (Re-run)

**Repository:** `[original workstation path redacted]`
**Original run:** 2026-07-23 · **Re-run:** 2026-07-23 (after `.dmk` data-source migration)
**Scope:** Cross-reference integrity — do inter-module/inter-suite references resolve, are numbered labels consistent, and do data-source references resolve to real files?
**Corpus:** 66 suites, 508 `module` declarations, 62 `.jad` data scripts, 67 `.dmk` files.

## Verdict

**All cross-references resolve. No dangling references remain.** The main gap from the first run — 62 data-source references pointing at non-existent `.json` files — is now **fully resolved**: every data source has been migrated to a real `.dmk` file and every reference resolves on disk. Two of the three prior findings are closed; the remaining item is a design observation, not a defect.

## Change since the first run

| Metric | First run | Re-run |
|---|---|---|
| Suites present (1–66) | 66 | 66 |
| Module declarations | 446 | 508 (+62 `.dmk` source modules) |
| `Suite_NN` integrate refs | 43, all resolve | 46, all resolve |
| Unresolved data-source refs | **62** (`from json` → missing files) | **0** |
| `from json("…")` in scripts | 62 | 0 |
| `from dmk("…")` in scripts | 0 | 62, all resolve |
| `.dmk` files present | 5 | 67 |
| Misspelled directory names | 3 | 0 |

## Full check results (re-run)

**1. Suite numbering (1–66).** Complete — every suite number present exactly once, no gaps, no out-of-range references.

**2. Module namespaces.** 508 declarations, internally consistent. The 62 new `.dmk` files each declare a unique `…​.source` namespace (e.g. `repository.anthology.chronology.source`); no duplicate module declarations.

**3. Suite integration references.** All 46 `Suite_NN_Name` labels inside `integrate { … }` blocks resolve to existing suites and remain number/name-consistent. No stray or malformed tokens.

**4. Data-source references — RESOLVED.** There are now **zero** `from json("…")` references in the `.jad` scripts. All 62 data sources are referenced via `from dmk("…")`, and **all 62 resolve to a file on disk** (0 unresolved). The specific gap called out last time — `suite_dependency_records.json` backing the suite-65 dependency graph — is filled by `Sandbox Engine/suite_dependency_records.dmk`.

**5. Governance actors.** `SOPHIA`, `CHARLOTTE`, `LANDON`, `Professor`, `Podium` all remain declared and are additionally referenced in every new `.dmk` coupling header (`support_layers { SOPHIA; CHARLOTTE; LANDON }`).

**6. New `.dmk` structural validity.** All 67 `.dmk` files pass structural checks: balanced braces, a `module` declaration, and an `emit` statement each. 0 suspect files.

**7. `.jad` structural validity.** All 62 migrated scripts are brace-balanced, and all 62 now carry the `coupling EightS_v1_0` (Smithson 8S Coupled Mechanics v1.0) block plus the extended schema/query fields.

**8. Directory names — RESOLVED.** The three previously-misspelled folders are now correct: `Perceiver`, `Training and Evaluation`, `Visual Correction System`. All 66 directories present with canonical names.

## Remaining observations (not defects)

**A. Artifact producer/consumer flow is still prose-named (design).** Modules describe consumed artifacts in `accept { … }` / `integrate { … }` and produced artifacts via `emit …`, using descriptive per-module names rather than a shared identifier space. This is unchanged and by design; it means end-to-end producer→consumer wiring still cannot be verified purely statically. A shared artifact-ID vocabulary would enable that if ever desired.

**B. `.dmk` templates are scaffolds, not populated data (expected).** The 62 new files are deterministic emitter templates: their kernels iterate `0..N` where `N` (row count) is bound at load, and no concrete rows are embedded yet. This matches the corpus's own `provisional-generated-not-production-compiler-validated` status. Populating them with real records is a separate step.

**C. Residual `emit json <catalog>` lines (optional).** Each `.jad` still ends with `emit json <query_catalog>` — the downstream query output, not the migrated data source. These were intentionally left as-is. If you want a fully `.json`-free pipeline, these query emits could also be migrated to `emit dmk`.

## Bottom line

The cross-reference graph is intact and now **complete on disk**: no dangling module, suite, or data-source references. The 62-file `.json` → `.dmk` migration closed the only substantive gap from the first run, and the directory-name inconsistencies have also been fixed. The only open items are optional polish (populate templates, migrate residual query emits, add a shared artifact-ID space) rather than integrity problems.
